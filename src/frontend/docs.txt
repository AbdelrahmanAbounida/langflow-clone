To Create a flow 

- we have nodes > takes nodeprops and edges 
- we create custom or generic node with custom data 
- in that data we add the info that we need to create custom component or task which represents the node view 

ex 
interface CustomNode extends Node {
    data: CustomNodeData
}
interface CustomNodeData {
    type: "A" // later when we read the prompt we could read this type to dynamically load custom components/tasks 
}

interface component {
    type: "A" // this should be enum 
    data: ...
    inputs:
    outputs:
}


- then we create genericNodeComponent function which takes node data 
and from this data we can load the type and then render the according component 

- nodeTypes = {
    CustomNodeData: genericNodeComponent // note left is the customnode we have and right is the generic component 
}
